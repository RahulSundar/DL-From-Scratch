# DL From Scratch: A worthwhile Project for anyone new to Deep learningly easy nowadays to 
It is fairly easy nowadays to find resources to learn Machine Learning from. However, the best way to learn any applied topic is to build something based on first principles. The knowledge and experience gained remain with us for longer. I would be hence building and training a feed forward neural network with 2 hidden layers for solving a regression problem from scratch using Python. 

So through this mini project of mine, I expect to build the following from scratch:
  - Single neuron
  - Backpropagation algorithm using automatic differentiation
  - Gradient descent solver for a n dimensional vector
  - FFNN with 2 Hidden layers


Stay tuned for updates!

Cheers!
